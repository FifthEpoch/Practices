# Portfolio

#### Little projects here and there. Some are from school, and some from the heart.

* Lots of [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/Practices/tree/master/Machine%20Learning/reinforcement-leanring) algorithms coded from scratch
* [Robitic project](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/reinforcement-learning/tree/master/RL-robotics) with reinforcement leanring 
* [Natural Language Processing](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/NLP) algorithms from scratch (e.g. [viterbi](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/NLP/blob/master/WK03/CH08/viterbi.py), [CKY parser](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/NLP/blob/master/WK05/CH17/CKY_parser.py), [Lesk](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/NLP/blob/master/WK06/CH23/wordnet.py))
* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/ML-TA) written for a machine learning class I was TAing for
* [Parallel programming implementation](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/Practices/tree/master/Parallel%20Computing) of basic algorithms in C
* [Pixel Ninja](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/Chaos_LSB), an online steganography tool that supports all Unicode-support language ([live site](https://bit.ly/chaos) & [demo video](https://www.ting.directory/pixel-ninja))
* [Wayback Headline](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/WaybackHeadlines), a web tool that enable users to investigate Google Trends data alongside relevant news articles and market data ([live site](https://bit.ly/wayback-headlines) & [demo video](https://www.ting.directory/wayback-headlines))
* [basic algorithms](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/portfolio/tree/master/Algo.%20%26%20Data%20Struc.%20-%20Java)
* playful explorations in [cellular automata](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/portfolio/tree/master/Sketches%20-%20Processing/Game%20of%20Life%20Variations) ([demo video](https://www.ting.directory/computer-science))
* [data point extraction](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/portfolio/tree/master/Data%20reporting%20-%20Java) with real data from Seattle Police Department  ([read more](https://www.ting.directory/data-report-generation))
* [steganography](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/portfolio/tree/master/Image%20Processing%20-%20Java) (using Least Significant Bit Insertion)
* image processing [filters](https://github.com/FifthEpoch/portfolio/tree/master/Image%20Processing%20-%20Java/Basic%20Image%20Filtering) application ([demo video](https://www.ting.directory/computer-science))
